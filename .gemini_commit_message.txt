feat: Implement Fire Spinner achievement logic and UI states

This commit implements the "Destroy 3 obstacles in a row using only the Ground Pound move" achievement for the Fire Spinner skill.

Key changes include:
- Updated `armorySkills` in `js/ui.js` to define the new unlock condition for Fire Spinner.
- Modified `getSkillUnlockProgress` and `checkSkillUnlockStatus` in `js/ui.js` to handle the `consecutiveGroundPounds` condition type.
- Added `consecutiveGroundPounds` to `state.playerStats` in `js/game-modules/state.js` for tracking.
- Implemented logic in `checkCollision` and `animate` functions in `js/game-modules/main.js` to increment `consecutiveGroundPounds` on successful Ground Pound destruction and reset it on other collisions, missed obstacles, or other destructive moves.
- Ensured `consecutiveGroundPounds` is correctly saved, loaded, and reset with the game state.
- Added a console notification when an Armory achievement is met.
