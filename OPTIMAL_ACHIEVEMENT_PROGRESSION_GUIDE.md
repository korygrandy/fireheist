- **Time:** 2-10 minutes initial play
- **Complexity:** ⭐⭐ Very Easy (passive accumulation)
- **How to Achieve:**

  2. Accumulate 100 total in-game days across sessions
  3. Unlock automatically when threshold hits
- **Why Second:** Extremely passive; happens naturally while working on other unlocks
- **Reward:** Cosmetic only (head 2x bigger)
- **Strategy:** Don't rush this; it unlocks passively as you play for other achievements

---

### **TIER 3: EASY (5-15 minutes - LOW-MODERATE SKILL)**

#### **#4: Jet Pack** 🚀 (NEWLY GATED)
- **Unlock:** Achieve 50 flawless hurdles
- **Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐ Easy (requires precision timing)
- **How to Achieve:**
  1. Start game on Rookie (more obstacles = more hurdle opportunities)
  2. Use Hurdle skill (Key: J) to jump over obstacles perfectly
  3. Each successful hurdle without getting hit = +1 count
  4. Accumulate 50 perfect hurdles in one game
- **Why Here:** Skill-based but achievable; Rookie makes it easier
- **Reward:** A-Tier (destroys 1+ obstacles per activation, scales with level)
- **Strategy:**
  - Play Rookie: Higher obstacle frequency (50% more accelerators)
  - Hurdle is free (no energy cost), instant cast
  - Use hurdles instead of jumps when obstacles approach
  - 50 hurdles = ~50-100 obstacle encounters on Rookie = ~5-8 minutes
- **Success Rate:** 70-80% (requires rhythm but not reflexes)
- **Tip:**

- **Reward:** A-Tier (teleport + burst damage, escape mechanic)
- **Strategy:**
  - Play 3-5 games on Rookie (each game: ~15-20 obstacles)

  - 50 incinerations / 15 per game = 3-4 games needed
  - On Rookie with good play: one solid game can hit 50
- **Success Rate:** 60-70% (depends on survival skill)
- **Tip:**
  - Use Ground Pound + Houdini in same session for synergy
  - Rookie difficulty makes it ~2x easier (double accelerators, 2x energy regen)

- **Reward:** A-Tier (screen-wide incineration slam)
- **Strategy:**
  - Play Rookie: ~2-3 minutes to get 10 consecutive obstacles
  - Ground Pound has low CD, recharges fast
  - If you break the streak, just restart (easy enough)
  - Estimated 5-7 minutes per attempt; 1-2 attempts needed

## 📈 PARALLEL TRACKING FOR EFFICIENCY

**Skills that unlock simultaneously (farm multiple at once):**

| Session Count | Farm These Together | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Fire Spinner + Fiery Ground Pound | Both use Ground Pound; just extend streak |
| 3-4 | Fiery Houdini + Firestorm | Both need 50-100 incinerations; one game |
| 5-10 | Fire Stomper + Echo Slam | Accumulate Ground Pound usage |
| 10-20 | Six Shooter + Fire Stomper + Echo Slam | Three grinds running in parallel |
| 20-50 | Shotgun + Molotov + Tarzan | All cumulative incinerations - just play |
| 50+ | Everything accumulates toward Reaper Drone | The ultimate parallel tracker |

**Pro Tip:** When grinding, pick 2-3 grind skills and farm them simultaneously. For example:
- Play a game using Fire Stomper (works toward Fire Stomper unlock) 
- Track Ground Pound usage (counts toward Echo Slam)
- Accumulate total incinerations (counts toward Shotgun/Molotov/Tarzan/Reaper)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR OPTIMAL PLAY

1. **Play on Rookie Difficulty** - 2x energy regen, higher obstacle frequency, lower collision range
   - Makes single-session unlocks 2-3x easier
   - Allows farming grinds faster

2. **Master Early Skills First** - Ground Pound, Houdini, Fire Spinner open all other paths
   - Ground Pound → Fiery Ground Pound → Fire Stomper (chain)
   - Incinerations → Fiery Houdini, Firestorm, Mage Spinner (parallel paths)

3. **Parallel Farming Strategy** - Track multiple counters simultaneously
   - Playing one game can progress 3-4 different unlocks
   - Example: One game = 1 toward Fire Stomper + 3 toward Echo Slam + 5 toward Shotgun

4. **Skill vs. Grind Balance** - Skill-based unlocks (Blink Strike, Jet Pack) early, grind-based later
   - Skill-based: 1-2 attempts = done (Fiery Ground Pound, Blink Strike)
   - Grind-based: 25-100 attempts = done (Tarzan, Reaper Drone)

5. **Time Investment Reality** - Total to get everything: 200-400 hours
   - But most of that is background grind (Tarzan/Reaper)
   - 80% of skills in first 10 hours
   - Last 20% takes 190+ hours (endgame only)
